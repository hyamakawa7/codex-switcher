## Installation

### Download a Release

The easiest way to install Codex Switcher is from the latest GitHub release:

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/Lampese/codex-switcher/releases/latest)

Choose the file for your platform:

- **macOS Apple Silicon:** `Codex.Switcher_*_aarch64.dmg`
- **macOS Intel:** `Codex.Switcher_*_x64.dmg`
- **Windows:** `Codex.Switcher_*_x64-setup.exe` or `Codex.Switcher_*_x64_en-US.msi`
- **Linux Debian/Ubuntu:** `Codex.Switcher_*_amd64.deb`
- **Linux AppImage:** `Codex.Switcher_*_amd64.AppImage`
- **Linux RPM:** `Codex.Switcher-*-1.x86_64.rpm`

> **macOS:** current release builds are not Apple-notarized. If macOS says the
> app is damaged, move it to `/Applications` and remove the quarantine flag:
>
> ```bash
> sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Codex Switcher.app"
> open "/Applications/Codex Switcher.app"
> ```

### Linux: launch at login and start in the tray

Open the top-right menu in the desktop app:

- **Launch at login** registers the installed executable with `--autostart` in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart/codex-switcher.desktop` (normally `~/.config/autostart/codex-switcher.desktop`). Turn it off to write a disabled entry (`Hidden=true`), also overriding a system-wide entry with the same name.
- **Start hidden in tray** saves `start_hidden` in `~/.codex-switcher/settings.json`. It takes effect on the next application start, for both manual and login launches. The window is created hidden; if tray creation fails, the main window opens.

Both settings default to off and are independent:

| Launch at login | Start hidden in tray | At login | Manual start when not running |
|---|---|---|---|
| Off | Off | Does not start | Opens the window |
| Off | On | Does not start | Starts in the tray |
| On | Off | Opens the window | Opens the window |
| On | On | Starts in the tray | Starts in the tray |

Use **Open Codex Switcher** or **Quit** in the tray menu. Launching the app again manually opens the existing window without leaving a second process; a second launch with `--autostart` preserves the existing window state. Linux keeps the tray icon visible while the main window is hidden, including when the saved tray display mode is Hidden. These preferences are unavailable in the browser dashboard and on other platforms.

Registration follows the [XDG autostart specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/autostart/latest/); duplicate launches use the [Tauri Single Instance plugin](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/single-instance/).

#### Build a local Debian package

Disable updater signing artifacts for this build only:

```bash
pnpm tauri build --bundles deb --config '{"bundle":{"createUpdaterArtifacts":false}}'
```

Before replacing an existing installation, quit the app and back up `/usr/bin/codex-switcher`, the autostart entry, `~/.codex-switcher/settings.json` (or record that it did not exist), and any external startup/hide helpers. Install the generated package with `sudo dpkg -i "src-tauri/target/release/bundle/deb/Codex Switcher_0.2.12_amd64.deb"`. Launch the installed executable and enable both preferences to retain an existing login-to-tray workflow. Enabling Launch at login replaces the external helper command with a direct executable command. Keep the old helpers in the backup.

#### Restore the previous local installation

Quit Codex Switcher. Set `backup_dir` to the directory holding the previous binary as `codex-switcher`, autostart entry as `autostart.desktop`, and settings as `settings.json` (or a `settings-was-absent` marker). Then run:

```bash
sudo install -o root -g root -m 755 "$backup_dir/codex-switcher" /usr/bin/codex-switcher
cp -a "$backup_dir/autostart.desktop" ~/.config/autostart/codex-switcher.desktop
if [ -f "$backup_dir/settings-was-absent" ]; then
  rm -f ~/.codex-switcher/settings.json
else
  cp -a "$backup_dir/settings.json" ~/.codex-switcher/settings.json
fi
mkdir -p ~/.local/libexec
cp -a "$backup_dir"/codex-switcher-autostart "$backup_dir"/codex-switcher-hide "$backup_dir"/codex-switcher-hide.c ~/.local/libexec/
~/.local/libexec/codex-switcher-autostart
```

This restores the backed-up binary and this PC's former helper-based startup. To restore package metadata as well after a version change, reinstall the previous Debian package instead of copying the binary. Verify automatic startup on the next actual login; directly launching the autostart entry does not test the desktop's login sequence.

### Maintaining a personal Linux fork

See [fork版の更新手順（日本語）](docs/fork-update-guide.md) for preserving the local startup preferences when incorporating upstream releases, rebuilding, installing, and rolling back.

### Auto Updates

Codex Switcher checks the latest GitHub release on startup. When a newer signed
update package is available, the app shows an update prompt and can install it
from inside the app.

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lampese/codex-switcher.git
cd codex-switcher

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

> **Windows:** the `pnpm tauri` script runs through a POSIX shell wrapper
> (`sh ./scripts/tauri.sh`) and will not work in PowerShell/CMD. Use the
> `tauri:win` script instead: `pnpm tauri:win dev` and `pnpm tauri:win build`.

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Run the Dashboard in a Browser

You can also serve the built dashboard over HTTP instead of opening the Tauri shell.

```bash
# Build the frontend and start the web server on 0.0.0.0:3210
pnpm lan
```

Optional environment variables:

- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_HOST` to override the bind host
- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_PORT` to override the port

The browser dashboard serves the same UI and backend actions through `/api/invoke/*`, which makes it usable over LAN, Tailscale, or a remote host tunnel when you expose the chosen port safely.

## Usage and Reset Credits

Codex Switcher shows two kinds of account usage information:

- **Rate limits** – the account card shows the current 5-hour and weekly limit
  windows, remaining percentage, reset timing, credit balance, and subscription
  expiry when available.
- **Usage Stats** – ChatGPT OAuth accounts can expand the **Usage
  Stats** panel to view stats such as lifetime tokens,
  today, last 7 days, last 30 days, streaks, longest task, token activity,
  reasoning/activity insights, and most-used integrations. The active account
  opens this panel by default; other accounts keep it collapsed until needed.
- **Manual reset credits** – OAuth accounts with available reset credits show a
  compact badge next to the plan badge. It includes the available count and the
  closest expiry date, hides zero-count results, and turns amber within 10 days
  or red within 3 days of expiry.

The tray popup also includes compact active-account stats for today and
the last 7 days, while keeping the normal rate-limit refresh flow separate.

## Safe Account Switching

ChatGPT can replace an OAuth refresh token after using it. Once replaced, the
older token may no longer be accepted. Before Codex Switcher writes another
account to `~/.codex/auth.json`, it now saves the latest tokens from the account
that is currently active. Switching back therefore restores the current session
instead of an older snapshot.

Token refreshes and account switches are serialized so a background refresh
cannot finish late and overwrite the account you just selected. Codex Switcher
also avoids refreshing the active account while Codex or ChatGPT is running;
close the running app before switching accounts.

If an older Codex Switcher version already saved an invalid refresh token, sign
in to that account again or remove and re-add it once. An invalidated token
cannot be recovered locally.

## macOS Dock and Menu Bar Mode

On macOS, Codex Switcher can either stay visible in the Dock or live only in the
menu bar. The first time you close the main window, the app asks which behavior
you want and lets you choose whether to show that prompt again.

You can change the same setting later from the tray popup or from the native
tray menu under **Dock Icon**. If you choose **Menu Bar Only**, the app keeps a
visible tray item so you can always reopen the main window or switch back to
Dock mode.

## Warm-Up

A warm-up sends one minimal request to an account so its current usage window
has activity before you need it.

- **Manual** – warm up a single or all accounts, from the main window or tray menu.
- **Automatic** – when enabled (per account or for all), the app tracks the
  5-hour window when available and warms it after each reset, as long as the
  weekly limit isn't exhausted. If only the weekly window is available, it
  warms once after the weekly reset and automatically returns to the 5-hour
  schedule if that window reappears.
- **Timed** – pick specific times of day (e.g. `08:00`, `13:00`, `18:00`) from
  the **Timed** control in the main window. At each time the app warms all
  accounts (skipping any whose weekly limit is exhausted), so you control when
  your 5-hour windows start instead of letting them drift.

Timed warm-up checks the schedule every 30 seconds, runs each configured minute
only once per day, and skips missed times if the machine was asleep instead of
warming accounts late.

On macOS you can keep the machine awake with the built-in `caffeinate` command,
which stops automatically when the app quits:

```bash
caffeinate -i -w "$(pgrep -x 'Codex Switcher')"
```

## Versioning

Use the version bump helper to keep app versions in sync across Tauri, Cargo, and the frontend.

```bash
# Exact version
pnpm version:bump 0.2.1

# Semver bumps
pnpm version:patch
pnpm version:minor
pnpm version:major

# Prepare a release commit and tag
# This prompts for a short release note and runs the version bump first.
pnpm release patch

# Prepare and push a release
# The tag stores the release note for the in-app update prompt.
pnpm release patch -- --push

# For non-interactive use, pass the note explicitly.
pnpm release patch -- --push --note "Fixed account switching issues"
```
